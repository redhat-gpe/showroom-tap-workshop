== Introduction
This workshop will take you on a journey through the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Throughout this journey, you will be playing different roles that will show you the kind of challenges faced by personas of developers, quality assurance engineers, and security engineers in this process, and how our solution, the Red Hat Trusted Application  (RHTAP), helps address those challenges. Our story unfolds over three chapters.

== Chapter 1: A Day in the Life of a New Developer
You will begin by stepping into the shoes of a new developer, eager to start writing great code. You will understand the value of Internal Developer Portals (IDPs), such as the Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH), in streamlining the onboarding process for new developers, making it not just efficient but also enjoyable. RHDH significantly reduces cognitive overload for developers, enabling them to focus on what matters mostâ€”writing great code.

== Chapter 2: Tightrope Walking without a Net
The story progresses as you don the hat of a Quality Assurance Engineer, uncovering the risks associated with providing developers with the tools to create great code without the necessary security guard rails vital for safeguarding the organization against security threats.

== Chapter 3: Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline to the Rescue
In our story's final chapter, you play the role of a Red Hat Consultant who demonstrates to the team the capabilities of Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline (RHTAP), showcasing how it can meet their security challenges without compromising developer productivity.
