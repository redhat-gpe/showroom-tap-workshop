= From Development to Deployment: Securing the Software Supply Chain with Red Hat OpenShift

This workshop focuses on the critical integration of security practices into the development and deployment processes using Red Hat OpenShift and a suite of Red Hat security tools. It highlights the necessity of embedding security early in the development lifecycle, known as "shifting left." It guides participants through hands-on activities transitioning from non-secure to secure development pipelines.

== Introduction to the Workshop

Welcome to an engaging session where integrating security into the development and deployment practices is discussed theoretically and applied practically. This workshop showcases the Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) and its significance in enhancing the developer experience through a centralized platform for resources, documentation, and tools.

Participants will journey through the transformation from a non-secure to a secure development pipeline, underlining the practical advantages of incorporating security tools such as The Update Framework + Fulcio + Sigstore (TAS), Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS), and SonarQube into their Red Hat OpenShift workflows.

== Workshop Challenge Overview

Participants are challenged to learn and apply the transition from using non-secure development practices to implementing a comprehensive, secure development pipeline. This transformation is essential for understanding how to effectively address vulnerabilities and incorporate comprehensive security checks and tools throughout the software development lifecycle.

== Presentation (30 mins)

=== Introduction to Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)

An in-depth overview of RHDH is provided, emphasizing its role in bolstering the developer experience with a wealth of resources centralized in one hub.

=== Understanding Security Tools

A presentation of essential security tools:

* *TAS (The Update Framework + Fulcio + Sigstore)*: Described as a set of tools enhancing software supply chains through signing and verification mechanisms.
* *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS)*: Explained as a solution for securing Kubernetes environments, focusing on vulnerability management and policy enforcement.
* *SonarQube*: Introduced as a tool for continuous code quality and security analysis.

=== Integration into Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline (RH TAP)

Discussion on integrating these security tools within RH TAP to establish a cohesive and secure application development and deployment process using Red Hat OpenShift.

== Hands-on Activity (1 hr 15 mins)

=== Scenario Setup

Two Golden Template Paths (GPTs) are preconfigured in RHDH: a non-secure pipeline and a secure pipeline, designed to facilitate the hands-on experience.

==== Part 1: Exploring the Non-Secure Pipeline

* *Builder Team*: Participants deploy an application using the non-secure GPT, identifying typical security oversights.
* *QA Team*: Participants deploy the unsecured image, identify vulnerabilities, and observe the consequences of bypassing security checks.

==== Part 2: Transitioning to the Secure Pipeline

* Facilitation by the Red Hat Consultant on the transition from non-secure to secure practices.
* *Builder Team*: Adopts secure development practices, including generating cosign key pairs and integrating TAS, for a secure image build process within Red Hat OpenShift.
* *QA Team*: Implements new security measures, successfully validating secured images with updated protocols, and safely deploying them, marking a transition to a secure operational model.

== Conclusion

The workshop wraps up by highlighting the pivotal role of the Red Hat Consultant in navigating the transition from insecure practices to a secure, efficient development and deployment pipeline using Red Hat OpenShift. The hands-on experience with RHDH, TAS, ACS, and SonarQube illustrates the actionable benefits of weaving these security tools and practices into development workflows, empowering participants to advocate for and implement robust security measures within their organizations.
