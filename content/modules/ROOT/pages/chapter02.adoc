== Chapter 2: Tightrope Walking without a Net

* As our story unfolds, you find yourself donning the hat of a QA engineer. 
* The moment you receive an email from the *Quarkus* Developer announcing the completion of his task, the baton is passed to you. 
* It's now in your hands to validate the integrity and quality of the code delivered.

'''

=== Testing the Insecure Application

* Your first action is to deploy the image, built by the developer, to the QA environment. 
* Your experience as a QA engineer has equipped you with a toolkit of scripts, designed to automate such tasks.
* You open your QA terminal, and type the command:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
sh deploy-insecured.sh
----

* As soon as the script completes its run and the application is deployed, you proceed to copy the application's URL and paste it in your browser, eager to start testing the application.

* But, oh no! 
* To your disbelief, the application has been compromised, now infected with a ransomware virus. 
* How could this have possibly happened?

* Without wasting a moment, you recognize the severity of the situation and know exactly what needs to be done. 
* You quickly report the issue to your organization's security team, urging them to launch an investigation into this critical breach.

=== Installing the Guard Rails

In the wake of the sophisticated ransomware attack that exploited vulnerabilities within our organization's software supply chain, a crucial meeting was convened. The conference room hosted the team involved in the incident, and you, a seasoned consultant from Red Hat, ready to guide the team through the crises. 

==== 1 Signed Commits

* "I understand you've encountered a serious issue with a ransomware infection.  Lets discuss the situation and how we can prevent this from happening again," you tell the team.
* *QA Engineer*:  (Visibly upset)  Yeah, I couldn't believe it!  How could this have happened?
* "Typically, vulnerabilities like this can happen when there's a gap in the software supply chain security," you explain.
* "The first step in addressing this is setting up your *Git* environment to sign code commits. This will allow us to verify the code's origin and integrity before it gets integrated into your build process.", you add.
* *Security Engineer*: So, you're saying that ensuring the code commits are signed can prevent tampering?
* "Exactly. I've already set up link:glossary.adoc#gitsign[*GitSign*,window=_blank] which is part of the link:glossary.adoc#rhtas[*Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer (RHTAS)*,window=_blank] on our developer's laptop."
* "You might have noticed that pop-up window from link:glossary.adoc#sigstore[*Sigstore*,window=_blank] requesting your credentials when you commit your code?" you ask the developer.
* *Developer*: "Yes! Does this mean my code commits are being signed?"
* "Correct," you confirm as you open a terminal to the development environment, and run the following command to show *GitSign* configuration 
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
git config --global --edit
----

image::75_GitSign_Config.png[]

* You enter ":q" to exit edit mode in the terminal as you explain, "All we need to do is add a step to verify that Code commits are signed in our build pipeline. I will show you this step in action when I demonstrate the full build pipeline run."

==== 2 Signed Container Images

* "Next, we'll build a container image from the verified code, this too needs to be signed."
* "We will use link:glossary.adoc#cosign[*Cosign*,window=_blank] to create a signing secret", you explain as you to execute the following command in the development environment terminal:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
COSIGN_PASSWORD=openshift cosign generate-key-pair k8s://openshift-pipelines/signing-secrets
----
* "This command," you continue, "generates a key-pair. We will configure link:glossary.adoc#tektonchains[*Tekton Chains*,window=_blank] to use this key in signing the container image." 
* "The public key, or cosign.pub, will be important later on for verifying the signatures of your images," you tell the QA Engineer.
* "Before deploying a container image to your QA environment, I will show you how you can use Enterprise Contracts to verify it's origin. This ensures that the image comes from your approved secure build system, not a random personal laptop."


image::76_Cosign_Secret.png[]

* In the Developer's terminal, you execute the command:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
cat cosign.pub
----

* Next, you switch to the QA terminal and enter:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
vi cosign.pub
----

* You paste the content of the public key into the file and save it by typing:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
:wq!
----

image::77_Copy_Public_Secret.png[]

* With the *Cosign* signing secret in place, the next step is to configure *Tekton Chains* to enable image signing. 
* "Now, let's configure Tekton Chains to start signing our images," you guide team as you run the following command in the *Development Environment* terminal:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
cd
cat <<EOF >> tekton-config.yaml
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TektonConfig
metadata:
  name: config
spec:
  addon: {}
  chain:
    artifacts.oci.storage: oci
    artifacts.taskrun.format: in-toto
    artifacts.taskrun.storage: oci
    artifacts.pipelinerun.format: in-toto
    artifacts.pipelinerun.storage: oci
    transparency.enabled: true
    transparency.url: http://rekor-server.rekor-system.svc
  config: {}
EOF
oc patch TektonConfig config --type='merge' --patch "$(cat tekton-config.yaml)"
----

image::33_Configure_Tekton_Chains.png[]

* "Finally we need to setup Cosign to use our TUF mirror registry, provide the cryptographic keys and trust information required for cosign to sign your software artifacts," you explain  as you run the following 
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
cosign initialize --mirror={tuf_mirror} --root={tuf_mirror}/root.json
----

image::78_Initialize_Cosign.png[]

==== 3 Generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
 
"We'll go a step further and create an attested Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)." 
* *Developer*: What is an SBOM?
* "Think of an SBOM as a complete list of ingredients in your application. It details all the open-source components and dependencies used to build your software. This transparency is key for swiftly identifying and addressing vulnerabilities," you explain.
* *Developer*: How does that help with Security?
* "Excellent question!  Having an SBOM with attestation is crucial. Let's say a known vulnerability is discovered in one of the open-source components used in your application. With an attested SBOM, you can quickly identify which versions of your application are affected and prioritize patching. Attestation ensures the SBOM itself hasn't been tampered with, providing confidence in its accuracy."

==== 4 Vulnerability Scanning and Policy Enforcement

* *Security Engineer*:  What about detecting vulnerabilities within the images themselves?
* "We'll include steps in the pipeline to perform both image scans and image checks against known CVEs and your organization's policies. This way, we ensure that the images are clear of known vulnerabilities before they're deployed," you answer.
* *Security Engineer*:  That sounds comprehensive. Implementing these measures would definitely strengthen our security posture.
* "Excellent! Let me prepare the necessary setup and then I will demonstrate our solution based on Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline (RHTAP) in action."
* "RHTAP provides pre-built pipelines with automated security checks, aiming to achieve the highest level of security (SLSA Level 3) for built artifacts and offers the capabilities I just explained."

=== Chapter 2 - Summary

As the baton passed to the QA engineer for testing, the narrative took a dramatic turn. The deployed application, instead of showcasing the fruits of their labor, revealed a critical vulnerability, it was infected with ransomware. This revelation abruptly interrupted the testing process and cast a shadow over the software supply chain's security, sparking concerns about vulnerability and exposure.

The next chapter of our story will showcase Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline in action. We will explore how integrating these security measures into the build and deployment pipelines can safeguard our software supply chain against the ever-present specter of cyber threats.
