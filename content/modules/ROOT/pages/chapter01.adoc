* You authorize *OpenShift Dev Spaces* to access your account by clicking the *Allow selected permissions* button. 

image::16_Allow_Selected_Permissions.png[]

* Subsequently, you grant *OpenShift Dev Spaces* access to your *GitLab* account.

image::17_Authorize_Gitlab.png[]

* *OpenShift Dev Spaces* then begins creating your workspace, processing a Devfile containing all the configuration needed to set up your development environment.

NOTE: A link:https://devfile.io/[*Devfile*,window=_blank] is a YAML configuration file that serves as a portable definition for a development environment. It is designed to be a universal format that can describe any type of development environment, making it easier for developers to code, build, test, and run applications across different tools and platforms without the need to manually configure each environment.

image::18_DevSpaces_Process_Devfile.png[]

* After waiting a few minutes for *OpenShift Dev Spaces* to finish setting up your workspace, you're greeted with a fully fledged IDE accessible from your browser. 
* You click the button *Yes, I trust the authors.*

image::19_Trust_Authors.png[]

* To accomplish your task, you decide to:

. Update the hello method in the ExampleResource.java class.
. Update the JUnit test verifying this method's output.
. Amend the documentation to reflect your changes.

NOTE: The JUnit test for the Hello method needs updating; otherwise, the Build step in the CI/CD pipeline would fail due to discrepancies between the code and its test.

* In your my-quarkus-app workspace, you expand the folders *src -> main -> java*, and then open the *ExampleResource.java *file. 
* On line 14, you replace the return message of the hello method from "Hello RESTEasy" to "Hello from RHDH".

image::20_Modify_ExampleResource.png[]

* Next, you update the JUnit test for this method. 
* You expand the folders *src -> main -> test*, and open the *ExampleResourceTest.java* file. 
* On line 18, you change the expected text from "Hello RESTEasy" to "Hello from RHDH".

image::21_Modify_ExampleResourceTest.png[]

* You recall your team's explanation that the documentation coexists with the code, nestled in the same git repository as a markdown file.
* You expand the docs folder and open the markdown file *Index.md*.
* At the document's end, you add: "Release 1.0: Update to ExampleResource.hello() method to return 'Hello from RHDH'."

image::22_Index_File.png[]

* Having completed your task, you're ready to commit your changes.
* You click on the *Source Control* icon located in the left menu.
* Then, you enter the commit message “My First Commit," and click on the *Commit* button to finalize your changes.

image::25_SYNC_Changes.png[]

* In the pop-up that follows, you click *OK* to push your changes and complete the process. 

image::26_OK_To_Push_Changes.png[]

* You've successfully implemented your change and updated the documentation in one commit, following the "docs as code" methodology where documentation is treated with the same level of care and under the same processes as source code. 
* You are delighted by knowing that following this methodology ensures that your documentation is as current as your code itself.
* Your commit triggers the build pipeline for your *Quarkus* application.
* You switch back to the *RHDH Dashboard* tab in your browser and select the CI tab from the top menu, ready to see your committed changes come to life.

image::27_Click_on_CI_Tab.png[]

* And just as you expected, a build pipeline has already been triggered.
* You eagerly expand the pipeline view to monitor the progress of the run. 

image::28_Expand_Pipeline_View.png[]

* After a few minutes of anticipation, the pipeline run concludes. 
* Your application image has been successfully built and pushed to the image registry.
* With a sense of accomplishment, your task now complete, you draft an email to the QA team, inviting them to begin testing your changes.

=== Testing the Insecure Application

* As our story unfolds, you find yourself donning the hat of a QA engineer. 
* The moment you receive an email from the *Quarkus* Developer announcing the completion of his task, the baton is passed to you. 
* It's now in your hands to validate the integrity and quality of the code delivered.

* Your first action is to deploy the image, built by the developer, to the QA environment. 
* Your experience as a QA engineer has equipped you with a toolkit of scripts, designed to automate such tasks.
* You open your QA terminal, and type the command:

[source, role="execute"]
----
. sh deploy-insecured.sh
----

image::29_Deploy_Insecure_Application.png[]

* As soon as the script completes its run and the application is deployed, you proceed to copy the application's URL and paste it in your browser, eager to start testing the application.

image::30_Copy_Application_URL.png[]

* But, oh no! 
* To your disbelief, the application has been compromised, now infected with a ransomware virus. 
* How could this have possibly happened?

image::31_Ransomeware.png[]

* Without wasting a moment, you recognize the severity of the situation and know exactly what needs to be done. 
* You quickly report the issue to your organization's security team, urging them to launch an investigation into this critical breach.

=== Chapter 1 - Summary

Our story unfolds with a bright-eyed developer starting his new role, welcomed by the innovative environment of the Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH). This Internal Developer Portal (IDP), with its Golden Path Templates (GPTs) streamlined and automated his onboarding process. These GPTs facilitated a self-service approach to project initiation, enabling the developer to quickly engage with his work.

However, as the baton passed to the QA engineer for testing, the narrative took a dramatic turn. The deployed application, instead of showcasing the fruits of their labor, revealed a critical vulnerability, it was infected with ransomware. This revelation abruptly interrupted the testing process and cast a shadow over the software supply chain's security, sparking concerns about vulnerability and exposure.

The next chapter of our story will delve into the arsenal of Red Hat's security tools and practices. We will explore how integrating these tools into the build and deployment pipelines can safeguard our software supply chain against the ever-present specter of cyber threats.
