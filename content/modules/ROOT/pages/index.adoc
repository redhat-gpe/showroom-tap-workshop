== Workshop Overview - {lab_name}

Welcome to the world of Hybrid Cloud! A utopian world where you can deploy and run applications anywhere you choose, be it on-premise or across any public cloud provider. However, this utopia does come at a cost. Developers find themselves managing a mix of traditional and cloud-native workloads, navigating through both legacy and modern runtimes and frameworks, all while under constant pressure to deliver projects quickly. This balancing act can easily overwhelm developers, leading to whatâ€™s known as *cognitive overload*.

Moreover, developers are often unaware of potential risks lurking within their code or, more critically, within external libraries. Remember the Log4j link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell[*Log4Shell*,window=_blank] mess?

This workshop introduces the *Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline (RHTAP)*, designed to help organizations create and deploy secure applications, while at the same time offering a seamless experience that minimizes cognitive load for developers.

Join us in this engaging workshop to learn more about the *Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline (RHTAP)* and how it can revolutionize your Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
